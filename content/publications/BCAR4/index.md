abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes, including influenza A virus (IAV) infection. However, the understanding of lncRNAs in IAV infection is limited. By using both bioinformatic analyses and virological assays, we showed that lncRNA BCAR4 expression can be highly induced by infection of multiple different IAV subtypes. BCAR4 was required for the propagation of IAV infection. Genetic inactivation of BCAR4 inhibited IAV growth. Investigation of the IAV infection cycle revealed a suppressed IAV viral RNA transcription and replication, and attenuated viral protein synthesis in the BCAR4-deficient cells. BCAR4 potentially interacted with cellular splicing-associated proteins and the activation of BCAR4 was associated with influenza viral NS segment. These findings suggest the important role of lncRNA BCAR4 in regulation of IAV infection.
