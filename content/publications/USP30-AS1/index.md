abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential components of innate immunity, maintaining the functionality of immune systems that control virus infection. However, how lncRNAs engage immune responses during influenza A virus (IAV) infection remains unclear. Here, we show that lncRNA USP30-AS1 is up-regulated by infection of multiple different IAV subtypes and is required for tuning inflammatory and antiviral response in IAV infection. Genetically inactivation of USP30-AS1 enhances viral protein synthesis and viral growth. USP30-AS1 is an interferon-stimulated gene, and the induction of USP30-AS1 can be achieved by JAK-STAT mediated signaling activation. The immune regulation of USP30-AS1 is independent of its proximal protein-coding gene USP30. In IAV infection, deletion of USP30-AS1 unleashes high systemic inflammatory responses involving a broad range of pro-inflammatory factors, suggesting USP30-AS1 as a critical modulator of immune responses in IAV infection. Furthermore, we established a database providing well-annotated host gene expression profiles IAV infection or immune stimulation.
